<h3><b>On a personal note</b></h3><br>
Apart from my regular CS stuff, I enjoy cooking in my spare time and love making a variety of sandwiches. I love being in and around nature, lakes especially, and hence travel from time to time to explore the world as much as I can. As a teenager I never read books much, but then 2016 converted me into an avid reader. I recommend everyone to read Sapiens. I am an adventurous person, <strong>Sky Diving</strong> is one of the thrilling adventures that I have experienced. <strong>3 2 1 ..... JUMP!!!</strong>
