<h3><b>Current</b></h3><br>
Working as a Software Development Engineering Intern at Amazon. I am also a graduate student at The <a href="http://cs.ucdavis.edu/">University of California, Davis</a> where I am pursuing Masters of Science in Computer Science. Prior to my masters, I was working as a Software Developer for a period of 3 years at SAP Labs, Bangalore, India. I completed my undergraduation at <a href="http://pict.edu/">Pune Institute Of Computer Technology</a> (affiliated to <a href="http://www.unipune.ac.in/">Savitribai Phule Pune University</a>).<br><br> 

My interests are in the field of Distributed Systems with a focus on Consensus Protocols and scaling distributed systems. Apart from that, I love to automate small things to speed up my tasks and make a stream lined process in order to have consistency in my work. Just out of curiosity, I also like to build small web applications, in order to stay in touch with the latest technologies. <br><br>

<h3><b>On a personal note</b></h3><br>
Apart from my regular CS Stuff, I enjoy cooking in my spare time and love making some interesting sandwiches. I love being in and around nature, lakes especially, and hence travel from time to time to explore the world as much as I can. I like reading books and have read over 50+ books in the past 3 years.
