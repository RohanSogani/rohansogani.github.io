					<h3><b>Scaling ResilientDB by Sharding​ </b> (<a href="http://github.com/DhruvKrish/resilientdb/tree/AHL">code</a>)</h3>
				  	
				  	<p class="subtext"><i>(With Dhruv Krishnan and Priya Holani; Mentored by <a href="http://expolab.org/">Prof. Mohammad Sadoghi</a>; January 2020 – June 2020)</i></p><br>  	

				  	<p>
						<a href="https://resilientdb.com/">ResilientDB</a> is an open-sourced permissioned blockchain fabric, which easily allows its users to set up a blockchain application.<br><br>
				  	
						Fault tolerance and scalability are the two major limitations of most distributed systems. In this project, we intend to show that sharding is a prominent solution to these limitations in distributed transaction processing, specifically for permissioned blockchain systems. We would achieve this by implementing a sharding protocol called AHL (Attested HyperLedger) in ResilientDB. AHL makes use of Trusted Execution Environment to improve fault-tolerance and sharding to enhance performance and scalability. ResilientDB is a high-throughput yielding permissioned blockchain system.<br><br>
				  	
						  Developed the sharding protocol by enhancing the Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerant protocol by using 2 Phase Commit Protocol. The result dramatically increased the system throughput by 200% to 240k txns/sec<br><br>
						  
						  Technologies: C++, Bash, Python, Google Cloud Platform<br><br>

					<h3><b>Paxos based consensus protocol in ResilientDB </b> (<a href="http://github.com/RohanSogani/library">code</a>)</h3>
				  	
				  	<p class="subtext"><i>(With Dhruv Krishnan, Priya Holani, and Shubham Pandey; October 2019 - December 2019)</i></p><br>  	

				  	<p>
				  		Implemented the BFT-SMaRt protocol inside of ResilientDB. The major changes were done to the VP consensus module of BFT-SMaRt which is a Paxos Based Consensus Protocol. Managed to improved the system throughput by 10%.<br><br>

			<p class="subtext"><i>(With Abhiraj Darshankar; Jan 2013 – March 2013)</i></p><br/>

			<p>
				A website where National Computing Competition (NCC) was hosted in which algorithmic questions were uploaded by the admin. The participants submit their code as a solution for a particular question whose verdict (Accepted, Wrong Answer, Compile Time Error, Run Time error etc.) was given by the Judge based on some pre- determined test cases. This Judge was developed on python that worked within a sandboxed environment which was created using a few bash shell commands. The backend was developed using the Django framework. <br><br>

				<p class="subtext"><i>(With Akash Shingte, Vishal Shelke; Aug 2014 – Sept 2014)</i></p><br/>

				<p>
					This application extracts and then displays the information regarding the books in the library such as the number of books, availability of a particular book to the user and the user could view the issued books as well as their deadlines. The server was designed using Node.js to send HTTP queries from Android to MongoDB and vice versa using the REST API.
				  Technologies: NodeJs, Java, MongoDB <br><br>
