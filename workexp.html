	<p>
		My research interest are in the field of Storage and Distributed Systems. I got an opportunity to work with some of the finest minds while working as a Graduate Student Researcher for the Exploratory Systems Lab at UC Davis, where I worked on <a href="http://resilientdb.com/">ResilientDB</a>, an open sourced permissioned blockchain. <a href="http://expolab.org/">Prof. Mohammad Sadoghi</a>, along with <a href="http://gupta-suyash.github.io/index.html">Suyash Gupta</a> and <a href="http://sajjadrahnama.com/">Sajjad Rahnama</a>, helped me guide through my research.<br>
		
		Research has not only taught me novel concepts, but it has also embarked a sense of discipline and focus which I believe is essential for success.

						ResilientDB is an open-sourced permissioned blockchain fabric, which easily allows its users to set up a blockchain application.<br><br>
				  	
						Fault tolerance and scalability are the two major limitations of most distributed systems. In this project, we intend to show that sharding is a prominent solution to these limitations in distributed transaction processing, specifically for permissioned blockchain systems. We would achieve this by implementing a sharding protocol called AHL (Attested HyperLedger) in ResilientDB. AHL makes use of Trusted Execution Environment to improve fault-tolerance and sharding to enhance performance and scalability. ResilientDB is a high-throughput yielding permissioned blockchain system.<br><br>
				  	
						  Developed the sharding protocol by enhancing the Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerant protocol by using 2 Phase Commit Protocol. The result dramatically increased the system throughput by 200% to 240k txns/sec<br><br>
						  
						  Technologies: C++, Bash, Python, Google Cloud Platform<br><br>

		University of California, Davis, is a rich and resourceful university and this is where I took a stab at Academic Teaching. I thoroughly enjoyed my time teaching young minds the concept of programming and it gave me immense pleasure to guide my students in order to shape their future.<br>
